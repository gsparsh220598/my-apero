## Problem Statement
- The challenge's goal is to predict the presence or non-presence of rice crops at a given location.
- This challenge will consider satellite data from the European Copernicus (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) program and NASA's Landsat program.

## Data Extraction
Satellite data is a unique and valuable tool for studying agriculture. Participants considered using optical data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat and radar data from Sentinel-1 in this challenge. All of these datasets are readily available from the Microsoft Planetary Computer ([HERE](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog)). Participants can choose one or more of these satellite datasets for their solution.
