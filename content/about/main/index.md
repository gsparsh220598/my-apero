  From a young age, I was driven by an insatiable curiosity, constantly questioning the world around me. This curiosity led me to explore various disciplines and discover the interconnectedness of ideas. After completing my undergraduate degree in engineering at BITS-Pilani, I stumbled upon the fascinating field of machine learning, which perfectly aligned with my interests in mathematics, programming, and problem-solving. 
  
  My first taste of applied machine learning came during an internship at the Aditya Birla Group, where I worked as a data scientist. This experience exposed me to the immense potential of ML in solving real-world problems across different industries.
  
  During my time at ABG (2020-2022), I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, from optimizing trading decisions to improving process efficiency in manufacturing. I leveraged techniques like ensemble learning, LSTM networks, Bayesian optimization, and distributed computing to tackle complex challenges and deliver significant results.

  To deepen my understanding of machine learning and its applications, I pursued a Master's degree in Applied Machine Learning at the Jindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas. During my graduate studies, I continued to explore new areas and work on projects in fields such as marketing, agriculture, finance, and drug discovery. 

  One of my proudest achievements was winning the EY Open Science Data Challenge by accurately predicting rice-crop presence in Vietnam using satellite data. I also developed advanced ML systems for drug discovery, optimized marketing strategies, and experimented with cutting-edge techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation.

  Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I am a passionate Kaggle enthusiast, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I believe that continuous learning is essential for staying at the forefront of the rapidly evolving field of machine learning.
